# PDB-annotations
An annotation file for converting PDB accessions into protein and species of origin. I did some searching and could not for the life of me find a single file where I could easily convert between the Protein Database (PDB) accession and the actual protein and species of origin, so I decided to make one through web-scraping. Hope you find it useful.
