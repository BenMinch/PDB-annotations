# PDB-annotations
An annotation file for converting PDB accessions into protein and species of origin. I did some searching and could not for the life of me find a single file where I could easily convert between the Protein Database (PDB) accession and the actual protein and species of origin, so I decided to make one through web-scraping. Hope you find it useful. 

## Potential Uses
The output file for running Foldseek (protein structure prediction and homology) gives PDB accessions that are best hits to your protein of interest. Using this file you can convert these to proteins and species to get more useful information.
